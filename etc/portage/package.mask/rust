# Currently, I don't use dev-lang/rust directly, and Rust presence
# on my system is purely dictated by build-time dependencies for
# certain packages:
#
# - dev-python/cryptography
# - dev-util/cbindgen
# - dev-util/maturin
# - gnome-base/librsvg
# - sys-apps/fd
# - sys-apps/ripgrep
# - www-client/firefox
# - ...
#
# All of these packages build just fine with either dev-lang/rust or
# dev-lang/rust-bin. Therefore, I mask dev-lang/rust to force the use
# of dev-lang/rust-bin when building other packages and speed up build
# time.

dev-lang/rust
